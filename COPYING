EDI contains two different licenses, this is due to it being the
development space for various components that expect to be 
moved to the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries in the future.

With the exception of "edi" which constitutes all remaining work
in this code base the licenses apply to projects within their
own top level directory. The project licenses are as follows:

data/extra/templates/	No license - public domain
