----

Normal compilation in /usr/local:

    meson . build
    ninja -C build
    sudo ninja -C build install

For meson build generic options:

    meson --help

For a list of project specific options supported:

    cat meson_options.txt

To set 1 or more project specific options:

    meson --prefix=/path/to -Doption=value [-Dother=value2] [...] . build

    mesonconf build

The above will only work after at least the following is done:

    meson . build
