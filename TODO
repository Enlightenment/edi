This project is under heavy and active development. We are working on
both a "Code-aware editor" as well as the IDE functionality at the same
time.

Editor
* Code folding
* Automatic code indenting / formatting
* notepad, emacs and vim and editing modes (key bindings)
* LLVM parsing
* Cross reference for c, c++ and some scripting language
* Support for EditorConfig - http://editorconfig.org/

IDE
* Integrated console

Widget (elm_code_widget)
* Improve the efficiency of the widget. Need to use much fewer
textgrids where possible.
